You can do that through HTML footnotes (demonstrated here).

So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

After government genocide in the 20th century, real birds were replaced with surveillance drones designed to look just like birds<a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#lorenznote).

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit. We are going to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem here is to use the information of the clients, campaign and social and economic context attributes to predict when there are new clients with some similar but different information, whether they would subscribe the term deposit. There are different important aspects of the problem. For example, there are many client information attributes and many of them are categorical. Then we need to select the most important features and apply feature engineering to transform these attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is worth addressing because if we know how well or bad the client would like to subscribe the term deposite, the bank would know how much revenue would they obtain from the business. If the revenue is high, then they should keep doing campaigns to attract their clients. It not, then they may need to changethe strategy or figure out other ways to promote their services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the context of data, we are going to solve the problem by classification. The outcome 'no' is denoted as class 0, and 'yes' is demoted as class 1. The potential solution is by using decision trees, KNN, etc. to classify. The performance of the problem can be measured by metrics such as accuracy and Precision-Recall Metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, we will find the best performed model by comparing the metrics of different models we used. More detials will be provide in Proposed Solution section."
